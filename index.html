                            In a gaming landscape where celebrity endorsements are commonplace, a notable exception has emerged in the form of Wong Cho Lam's earnest engagement with this game. Unlike many celebrities who merely lend their name to gaming promotions, Wong Cho Lam has been captured seriously into the gameplay, demonstrating a genuine enthusiasm for the experience.

                            While Wong Cho Lam is not officially affiliated with this mobile game as an endorser, his sincere involvement with the game has garnered attention. His serious approach to playing this game sets him apart from other celebrities who often participate in gaming promotions superficially, merely for appearances.

                            As a multi-faceted artist, Wong Cho Lam has always shown himself as a humorous and versatile artist since his debut, and has a high popularity. We all know that Wong Cho Lam has imitated many classic roles. Based on the source, Wong Cho Lam has been playing this game for a couple of years. Moreover, the team of this mobile game is planning to invite him as an official endorser, not only to recognize the quality of the mobile game, but more importantly, to shoulder the mission of promoting traditional Chinese culture. As the classic mobile game by Four Nine Games that promotes traditional Chinese culture, this mobile game authentically restores the scenes of the original animation and enriches the game's connotation with classic culture. This game spirit deeply inspired Wong Cho Lam. I am willing to join hands with 49 Games to spread positive energy to the public.

                            In response to the question of whether Wong Cho Lam would accept an invitation to become an endorser for this mobile game, recent researchers suggest a positive outcome. The collaboration between Wong Cho Lam and 49 Games has been formally announced, although no specific details about a video release have been disclosed. This partnership aims to leverage Wong Cho Lam's popularity and align it with the nostalgic appeal of this mobile game. Through potential future promotional efforts, such as brand videos evoking "Classic Feelings," both parties seek to enhance the game's reputation and market presence.
